                <h3>Who we are</h3>
                <p>FOOGS is a fresh and organic online grocery store. We provide our consumers with organic and
                  locally produced products, as well as preservative-free items. Our overall variety of items
                  is more healthy than those offered in regular grocery stores. It's also an excellent alternative
                  for those who are too busy to go to the market and purchase items.
